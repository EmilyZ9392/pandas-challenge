Py City Schools Written Report 

Observation 1:
Average Math and Reading scores, as well as average passing rates are higher for Charter schools than District Schools.

Observation 2:
Average Overall Passing percentage decreases drastically (almost 30%) in schools with more than 2000 students. 

Observation 3:
Average Math and Reading scores, as well as average passing rates are higher among schools that spend less than $585 per student compared to average for schools that have a higher spending amount per student. 

Observation 4:
The lowest performing school (Rodriguez High School) has a per student budget of $637.00, which is $55 more than the highest performing school (Cabrera High School) at $582.00 per student. 

The above observations are based on the analysis done using the PyCitySchools-Copy1.ipynb in this repository. The analysis uses data on the Reading and Math Scores of 15 different High Schools to draw conclusions on how/if there is a correlation between school size, budget, and school type and performance. The Jupyter Notebook also contains analysis of scores by grade level within each school.
